## About

### Built With

The ForceFacts app follows a modular architecture that promotes separation of concerns and modularity. It consists of the following modules, each responsible for specific functionality:

- **App Module**: The main module of the app that encompasses the app build and basic configuration elements.

- **Feature Modules**: It contains all user-interface and user-related components such as Fragments, Adapters, ViewHolders and so on..., it also stores of view-models, so ui components could gather data.

- **Core Modules**: The core module contains all necessary data, utility, shortly "backend" components that app needs to work. Also it stores elements needed in multiple modules, such as test constants, some ui elements and utilities.

- **Domain Module**: Encapsulates the core business logic and use cases of the app. It defines interfaces and contracts that the data layer must implement.

- **Data Module**: Implements the repositories defined in the domain module and acts as a bridge between the domain and the external data sources. It incorporates the following Android Architecture Components:
  - Room: Handles local database caching and retrieval.

- **Network Module**: Handles data retrieval from external APIs and utilizes Retrofit for network communication.

- **Model Module**: Contains data classes that are needed across the whole app

- **Cache Module**: An Android-specific module that focuses on storing and accessing data locally. It includes Room for local database caching and Shared Preferences for managing application preferences.

By following this modular architecture, the ForceFacts app achieves a clean separation of concerns, promotes code reusability, and facilitates easy maintenance and testing. The app also incorporates several Android Architecture Components, such as LiveData, ViewModel, Data Binding, and Room, to enhance its functionality and provide a smooth user experience.
